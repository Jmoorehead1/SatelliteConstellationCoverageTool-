# SatelliteConstellationCoverageTool-
This project was an exploration of satellite constellation design and coverage analysis. I developed a Python tool using libraries like Skyfield to simulate satellite orbits and calculate how well a constellation could cover Earthâ€™s surface. The goal was to build a simplified version of the kind of planning tools used by companies like Starlink or OneWeb to deploy low Earth orbit satellite networks.

The purpose was to model multiple satellites in circular orbits and visualize their ground tracks, revisit times, and surface coverage over time. I wanted to understand how many satellites were needed at a given altitude to ensure frequent pass-over of any location on Earth. The project involved calculating orbital periods, simulating orbital planes, and projecting satellite footprints onto a 2D map.
